# Aed Duales code piece
A piece of code of our current project, a platform cooperative multiplayer game named Aed Duales.
Two manager class files are available:
<ul>
<li>**SaveLoadManager** is the class used to save Serializable data classes that we called "DataStruct" into binary files, or to load these data by reading the files in which they are stored.</li>
<li>**SoundManager** is the class used to update the sounds volume of the game each time a player's volume settings has been modified. Since Aed Duales is a local multiplayer game in splitscreen, we wanted to use stereo to make players understand when a sound is made near to one of them.</li>
</ul>
